# Useful-PHP-Classes
Here's where I keep all of the classes I use on a regular basis in my php programming, mainly to 
keep myself from reinventing the wheel.

Classes included so far:

template.class.php - this one is my attempt at a simple template engine.
db.class.php - this is used to connect to a db.  right now it's only set for MySQL, but I may include PostgreSQL
    as well.
    
All of these classes have been sanitized for the public's use.  Meaning, I've removed passwords and urls that 
I wish to keep private.
